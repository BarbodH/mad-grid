Publishing on Google Play soon.

## About

Mad Grid is a visual sequence memory game originally inspired by [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/).
The game consists of a 2Ã—2 grid, which displays a randomly generated sequence to be perfectly replicated by the user.
The game becomes progressively more difficult as the length of the sequence increments in each level.

## Features

Mad Grid consists of three game modes:
- Classic: the sequence simply increments by one following the successful completion of each level.
- Reverse: similar to Classic mode, but the user is required to replicate the sequence in reverse order.
- Messy: similar to Classic mode, but an entirely new sequence is generated following the successful completion of each level.

Additional features include:
- Guide page providing text descriptions and a video demonstration for each mode.
- Adjustable sequence display speed (1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 2.5x).
